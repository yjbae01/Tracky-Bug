# Tracky-Bug

Tracky-Bug is a ticketing or bug logging application that allows the user to manage and view logs of issues that may occur in their project. Tracky-Bug allows all users to join multiple projects and also create projects of their own.

# To Do:

- Users would need to login using their given credentials (All users are created by administrators of certain projects). 
- All users can create their own project and can become administrator of that project. User, bug and project information are all stored in a MariaDB server.
- The server application will allow the user to run a MariaDB server that will provide all data and functions. 
- The GUI panel is to be fully dynamic using the server to provide functions. 
- If the server is not running the user should not be able to log in.
